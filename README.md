## Middleman, S3, & Skeleton quickstart

### Install Middleman

The goal here is just to get you running middleman as quick as possible. We are just going to download the right ruby gems, run the server, and make a simple change to prove that everything is working.

1. ensure you have ruby installed type `ruby --version` at the console.  Version 2.0+ would be good. One recommended way to install and manage ruby versions is to use [RVM](https://rvm.io/). But I am omitting that step.
2. install [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) gem `gem install middleman`
3. initialize a middleman project `middleman init our-project`
4. start the server: `cd our-project; middleman server` -
5. open a browser to http://localhost:4567/
6. make some changes to the file `our-project/source/index.html.erb` â€“ _`erb` files are ruby template files. Ruby inside of `<%= %>` blocks will be evaluated, this file becomes a `.html` file. Have a look at http://localhost:4567/__middleman/sitemap/ to see how sources files are mapped._
7. reload the browser and see your changes!

### Middleman Customizations:

####  LiveReload

Pressing the browser `refresh` button is slow. When a file changes, the browser should update instantly. We can do that with LiveReload. We will also be replacing `hmtml.erb` files with '.slim'. Finally we will add [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) to our project, and try some new styles.

4. Stop your currently running version of middleman, if its running by using `ctr-c` in the console where you started it.

5. add LiveReload for instant (reload-free) browser updates. This will speed up development.
  1. First install the [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en).
  2. Configure Middleman to use it. Do this by uncommenting lines `39-41` in `our-project/config.rb` so that it looks like this:

          # Reload the browser automatically whenever files change
          configure :development do
            activate :livereload
          end

6. Start your sever again `middleman server` and open http://localhost:4567/

7. Make changes to `our-project/source/index.html.erb`. When you click `save` in your editor, you should notice your browser refresh immediately.
